ran it for the first time, seems to be good but formatting is horendous, fixing using endl and stuff like that

fixed that but now have to fix the output of when the cars are full, have to move the if statement

bigger problem, it seems the waiting loop is being re initialized to 0 each time, need to fix this urgently, i moved the waiting line outside the loop it should be okay now

Amount of waiting cars is unclear, make sure to add this to output (did this using the list.size() function

Had error of looping the output that i only wanted to appear once, fixed using different condition i believe

new issue with no new lines on formatting output, added new line on two different instances to make output more clear
